## Translator Instructions

This page is linked from our internationalisation platform, Transifex,
in order to provide a few indications to the translators

#### Glossary

An initial glossary [is available
here](https://github.com/sourcefabric-innovation/citizendesk-core/blob/master/glossary.csv). Simple
changes can be made from the web interface by anyone provided with a
Github account.

#### Hard returns in strings

Strings may have hard returns signs. They can be safely omitted in the
translation since they have no effect within the HTML markup.

#### Citizendesk or Citizen Desk?

Currently the correct way to refer to the product is *Citizendesk*
